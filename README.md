# fmljupyter (FAMILIAR on Jupyter) 

Ongoing effort to put advanced feature model management into the Web (Jupyter). 
What about writing the following line right in the browser: `FM ("H : [E] [LL] [O] (W|R); W -> LL;").counting();`
and of course obtaining the answer 12?  

## Motivation 
FAMILIAR (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning) is a language for importing, exporting, composing, decomposing, editing, configuring, computing "diffs", refactoring, reverse engineering, testing, and reasoning about (multiple) feature models. All these operations can be combined to realize complex variability management tasks: https://familiar-project.github.io/

We have made several attempts in the past for democratizing the use of FAMILIAR (e.g., for teaching):
 * with an executable JAR and a command line/console 
 * withing Eclipse 
 * with a dedicated graphical tool 
 * with Docker
 * programmatically, with a fluent API in Java 
and online (demonstration here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYEN4hY0jC0) 
We relied on Play! framework 2.2.0 (http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.0) and some Javascripts (ACE editor and jqconsole): https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/webfml http://familiar.variability.io/ide/familiar 

## Jupyter

It's yet another attempt to put FAMILIAR online, this time with Jupyter.
